## 🖼️ Overview
**Artistry** is a responsive art gallery web application built using **HTML**, **CSS**, and **JavaScript (LocalStorage)**.  
It allows users to browse artworks, view details, and manage the gallery through login and CRUD (Create, Read, Update, Delete) functionality.

The project simulates an online art platform where users can manage digital exhibitions directly in the browser — no backend or API required.
