## 🧭 Overview

**Artistry** is a responsive front-end web application that allows users to explore, create, edit, and manage artworks through a clean, gallery-style interface.  
The project demonstrates fundamental skills in HTML, CSS, and vanilla JavaScript — including DOM manipulation, data handling, validation, and authentication — as outlined in the FED1 curriculum.

The app is built entirely with **vanilla HTML, CSS, and JS** (no frameworks), and it interacts with locally stored mock API data to simulate CRUD functionality.
